    <h2>About Us</h2>

    <p>This website is designed to work as a trouble ticket system by Stephen Fedele, James Ward, Allin Kahrl, and Kristina Maki for the 2017 CS3500 Semester Project. The user creates tickets for problems they might be having and saves them in their user account. Suggestions for these problems are generated and the user is given the option to accept the suggestion and change the status of the ticket. </p>
